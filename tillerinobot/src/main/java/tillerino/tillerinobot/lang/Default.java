		 * *Translator* with your osu name and *Language* with the name of the

		 * You don't need to use the line above, and you don't have have to give

		 * For example, in the German translation, I just used the line
		 * "Nichts leichter als das!", which translates literally to
		 * "Nothing easier than that!", which refers to German being my first
		 * language.
